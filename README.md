# Dockerized-Gatsby-Strapi
*✍️ WiP*

This repository aims to serve as a starterkit for a self-hosted [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) bootstrapped as Docker containers ready to be deployed. 

### Motivation

I wanted to create a modern web environment that is *convenience-first* (similar to Wordpress with the [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin installed, but less monolithic), uses a modern tech-stack under the hood (Node.JS), is cheap to host (Any Docker host, really) and SEO-friendly ([SSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/choosing-the-best-page-rendering-modes-for-your-gatsby-site/#gatsby-skip-here)).

### Getting started
