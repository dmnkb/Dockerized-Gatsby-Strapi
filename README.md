# Dockerized-Gatsby-Strapi
*‚úçÔ∏è WiP*

This repository aims to serve as a starterkit for a self-hosted [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) bootstrapped as Docker containers ready to be deployed. 

### Motivation

I wanted to create a modern web environment that is *convenience-first* (similar to Wordpress with the [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin installed, but less monolithic), uses a modern tech-stack under the hood (Node.JS), is cheap to host (Any Docker host, really) and SEO-friendly ([SSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/choosing-the-best-page-rendering-modes-for-your-gatsby-site/#gatsby-skip-here)).

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the gatsby CLI globally on your system `npm install -g gatsby-cli` or `yarn global add gatsby-cli`
3. `cd` into the *gatsby* folder and install the dependencies `npm install` or `yarn`
4. `cd` into the *gatsby* folder and add an *.env* File with following contents:
```
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=<YOUR_APP_KEYS>
API_TOKEN_SALT=<YOUR_API_TOKEN_SALT>
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=<ADMIN_JWT_SECRET>
JWT_SECRET=<JWT_SECRET>
```
To generate *.env* contents you could install a separate strapi instance using `npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project --quickstart
` which can be deleted afterwards.

5. Run `make dev` in order to run Strapi and a Postgres database dockerized and Gatsby in development mode.
6. Locate Gatsby under `localhost:8000` and Strapi under `localhost:1337`
7. In order to make Strapi expose the preconfigured *Pages* collection type, navigate to Settings -> Roles -> Public and make sure "find" under *Pages* and everything under *Content type builders* is checked. If gatsby is throwing an error please rebuild the data layer or refer to the Gatsby documentation.

### Troubleshooting

As pointed out at the beginning this project is aimed at convenience and a nice developer experience. I'm open to suggestions and contributions! üöÄ
